# BLERSSI Location Prediction using Kubeflow Pipelines

## What we're going to build

To train, serve using kubeflow pipeline and prediction for client request through jupyter-notebook.

## Infrastructure Used

* Cisco UCS - C240M5 and C480ML

## Setup

### Install NFS server (if not installed)

To install NFS server follow steps below.

#### Retrieve Ingress IP

For installation, we need to know the external IP of the 'istio-ingressgateway' service. This can be retrieved by the following steps.  

```
kubectl get service -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway
```

If your service is of LoadBalancer Type, use the 'EXTERNAL-IP' of this service.  

Or else, if your service is of NodePort Type - run the following command:  

```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Use either of 'EXTERNAL-IP' or 'INTERNAL-IP' of any of the nodes based on which IP is accessible in your network.  

This IP will be referred to as INGRESS_IP from here on.

#### Installing NFS server, PVs and PVCs.

Follow the [steps](./../install/) to install NFS server, PVs and PVCs.

### Create Jupyter Notebook Server

Follow the [steps](./../notebook#create--connect-to-jupyter-notebook-server) to create & connect to Jupyter Notebook Server in Kubeflow

### Upload Notebook file

Upload [BLERSSI-Pipeline-Deployment.ipynb](BLERSSI-Pipeline-Deployment.ipynb)

### Run BLERSSI Pipeline

Open the BLERSSI-Pipeline-Deployment.ipynb file and run pipeline
